##Create your first voting app with Sinatra

*Created by Piotr Szotkowski, @chastell *

We will create a little voting app from scratch using a web development framework for Ruby called Sinatra, which is much like Ruby on Rails. Just another tool to get the job done really, and a fun one too!

Imagine your group of friends is figuring out what to order for your weekly movie watching marathon. With the many fast food options out there, this can become quite a discussion. This is where our app comes into play!
